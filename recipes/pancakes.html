    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>15 Oreo Chocolate Sandwich Cookies, Finely crushed</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>4 tablespoon of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>extra crushed Oreo For topping</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and crushed Oreos. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the beaten eggs, milk, and 4 tablespoons of the melted butter.</li>
        <li>Add wet mixture to the dry mixture. Combine well, but donâ€™t overmix. Batter should still be slightly lumpy. If time permits, allow batter stand for at least 30 minutes. Batter can even be covered and refrigerated overnight until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Heat skillet over medium heat. Add enough butter to thinly cover pan. Ladle the batter 1/3 cup at a time. Cook pancakes until done and slightly browned on each side. Repeat, cooking pancakes in batches adding butter to pan as needed.</li>
    </ol>
